## Installation

This installation guide assumes that the application is being installed on the latest version of [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu).


### Prerequisites

1. Install Python development packages using, `sudo apt-get install python-dev`
2. Install [Python pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip) using `sudo apt-get install python-pip`
3. Install Python MySQLDB package using, `sudo apt-get install python-mysqldb` 
4. Install [virtualenv](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv) using `sudo pip install virtualenv`
5. In the project root, run `virtualenv venv`
6. Activate the virtual environment using `. venv/bin/activate`
7. Once the virtual environment is active, run `pip install -r src/requirements.txt`
8. To deactivate the virtual environment, type `deactivate` and hit ENTER.


### Configuration

All the project configurations are done in the file `settings.py` located at `src/core/settings.py.sample`. Rename it to `settings.py` before adding any configurations or modifying them.  

Some Ideal configurations for development are listed below.


```

DEVELOPMENT = True
DEBUG = True

```


### Setting up the Database

1. Create a database with any name you wish.
2. Then change directory to `src/core` using `cd src/core`
3. Update the schema from alembic version files using the command, `alembic upgrade head`
4. When you edit the schema and want to sync it to the database, go to `src/core` and run the command `alembic revision --autogenerate -m "<revision_message_here>"`. Here the revision message is a simple short line telling what was changed just like a git commit message. Then run, `alembic upgrade head`


## Development Workflow

1. Rename the `settings.py.sample` using the command, `mv settings.py.sample setting.py`
2. Make appropriate settings in `settings.py`
3. Go to `src/scripts` and run `source dev.sh`.
4. Run the migrations as mentioned in the previous section.
5. Go to `src/` and run the application using, `python run.py` and point your browser to the url that gets displayed.


## Coding Standard

We follow the [official Python coding standards (PEP8)](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) where ever possible. As a quick round up of it,

1. Use 4 spaces for indentation and not tabs.
2. Make sure you maintain maximum around 80 characters per line of code.
3. Variable & Class names follow `CamelCase` notation with the exceptions of function names / model's datamembers which follow `under_score` notation.
4. Finally, make sure the code you write is readable and maintainable with a fair amount of relevant comments.
